Project Name

Gampahin Husmak

Project Overview

Gampahin Husmak is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to support tree plantation, monitoring, and environmental responsibility in the Gampaha District, launched in line with Sri Lanka’s Independence Day initiatives.

The platform allows citizens to record trees they have planted, track their growth over time, and report issues, while providing a powerful, role-based admin management system for monitoring, approvals, and decision-making.
